          <div><h3><br><br><br><br>Bollywood Bound Dance Club</h3><p>Recently, I have been in the processing of starting a bollywood dancing club in our school to allow some of the students to express themselves creatively. With the stress and pressure of assignments and exams in school, I have understood that I need to take some time to destress, and personally dancing has really helped me with this. I wanted to encourage other people to try to dance for enjoyment and express their creativity even during COVID-19, so I established this club as an online platform to destress from school activities.
