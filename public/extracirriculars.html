          <div><h3><br><br><br><br>Masks Drive</h3><p>I made 60 masks from scratch by cutting the material, sewing all the pieces together and attaching elastic pieces. These masks were then distributed to the children at Child Advocates of Fort Bend County so they can remain safe during the spread of COVID-19. This is one of my most favorite projects I have done because these supplies were then helpful to children encouraging them to remain safe and hygenic during these troubling times.<br><br>Contact: Metoyer Martin<br>mellis@cafb.org</p></div>

          <div><h3><br><br><br><br>Houston International Fashion Week</h3><p>I helped wrap around 50 gift and create gift baskets for the Houston International Fashion Week as well as distributing certain materials and helping the event get coordinated. We also participated in the fashion show by walking on the runway with our robot. We also helped models get their necessary jewelry and clothing items before running out.<br><br>Contact: Lori Cohee<br>lori@tlcdynamics.com</div>

          <div><h3><br><br><br><br>Bollywood Bound Dance Club</h3><p>Recently, I have been in the processing of starting a bollywood dancing club in our school to allow some of the students to express themselves creatively. With the stress and pressure of assignments and exams in school, I have understood that I need to take some time to destress, and personally dancing has really helped me with this. I wanted to encourage other people to try to dance for enjoyment and express their creativity even during COVID-19, so I established this club as an online platform to destress from school activities.<br><br>Contact: Colleen Thompson<br>281-234-1293</div>
