      <p>I am currently a student at the Obra D. Tompkins High School. I'm from Texas but born in India. At the moment, I am deeply interested in the Statistics and Computer Science fields and am looking into a data scientist career. A value that is really important to me is family. I believe that everyone should be treated equality and respected in order to have a hostile-free work place, instead fostering a tight-knit workplace. I also support organization and like working as a team because it teaches compromise and progresses ideas in new and unique directions. </p>

        <p class="fadeIn">I'm Ishita Jain. If your interested, here are some fun facts about me: I have a brother who is 3 years older than me and, I have a dog named Monty. I love learning new things, currently including the creation of this website! My favorite color is light blue. I love practicing art forms as expression such as drawing, photography, and dancing to improve.</p>

    <p>These images are some artwork that I occassionally work on including drawing and photography. I practice drawing sometimes as a hobby and I love improving my realsim techniques whenever I have time. I also deeply enjoy travelling and taking photos, even though I am not an expert in photography since I enjoy it.</p>
