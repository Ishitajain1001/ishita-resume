      <p>I am currently a student at the University of Texas at Austin majoring in mathematics. I'm from Texas but born in India. I am currently looking for a Data Science internship to give me real world experience to apply the Statistics and Computer Science knowledge I have gained in college. I believe that everyone should be treated equality and respected in order to have a hostile-free work place, thus fostering a tight-knit workplace. I also would love to participate in any Women in Technology organizations at my workplace.</p>

          <div class="figcaption"><p>I drew this eye in order to display emotion in my artwork. I strived to show a sense of determination and fierceness with the shape of her eyebrow and the simple eyeliner extending out.</p></div>

    <p>These images are some artwork that I occassionally work on including drawing and photography.

I also deeply enjoy travelling and taking photos, even though I am not an expert in photography since I enjoy it.</p>
