          <div><h3><br><br><br><br>Bollywood Bound Dance Club</h3><p>Recently, I have been in the processing of starting a bollywood dancing club in our school to allow some of the students to express themselves creatively. With the stress and pressure of assignments and exams in school, I have understood that I need to take some time to destress, and personally dancing has really helped me with this. I wanted to encourage other people to try to dance for enjoyment and express their creativity even during COVID-19, so I established this club as an online platform to destress from school activities.

              <p>As a VP of the Steel Talons 5427 FIRST Robotics team and I help our team raise money to buy parts of our robot and for our outreach team events by finding sponsorships for our team, contacting corporate companies and families. Currently I have been working on developing a sponsorship packet for our team to send out to sponsors as well as a video to highlight how much we value their sponsorships and how much it has contributed to our team's success. I originally started off as a fundraising leader in 2019 and then got promoted to become a Vice President for our team.</p>

              <p>I initiated this club in my highschool as an outlet for stress and dancing. As the Co-President, I create choreography for our dances as well as the other officers, fill out the paperwork most of the paperwork for our club, develop and manage our club's website through a platform, and manage our social media. I also coordinate events for potential performances and guide the other officers with their tasks. Currently, I have been attempting to create classes to teach kids Bollywood Dance within our community as a way to raise money for our team and to donate money to other organizations.
